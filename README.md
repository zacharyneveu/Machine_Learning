# About
This repo contains my homework assignments for ECE 5640: Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, taught by David Brady at Northeastern University.  Along with homeworks, I have included various experiments that I've done over the course of the class to work on specific concepts, or programming-related issues.  The class is taught in Matlab, however I prefer Julia (or Python), so I have tried to duplicate my notebooks in Julia.  All Matlab notebooks are runnable with the open-source Octave kernel.

# Topics (So far)
+ Linear Algebra Review
+ Bayesian Classification
