# Urban Sound Recognition

## Top Level Files
`supervised_classification.m` - Performs feature extraction and supervised classification using algorithms from class.
`feedforward_nn.m` - Trains feed-forward neural network using spectrogram data.
`resnet_nn.m` - Trains an 18 layer Residual Network to recognize sounds from spectrogram data.

NOTE: `resnet_nn.m ` uses the spectrograms created from `feedforward_nn`, so run `feedforward_nn.m` first and do not clear your work space before running `resnet_nn.m`.
